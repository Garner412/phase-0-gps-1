# GPS Reflection

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	- Prior to the GPS session, I wasn't quite comfortable pulling from GitHub to my local repo. 
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	- After going over git pull and git fetch I was able to better understand some of the syntax used to acquire the information I need more efficiently.
	- Also, some general questions regarding pairing (simple stuff, the best way to screenshare, etc)
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	- I asked my pair to explain git fetch more thoroughly, as well as how he was auto completing file names.
	- I asked my guide questions regarding drivers/navigators and best practices (naming files, making comments, etc). I asked him to clarify a few Git commands that I was kind of guessing on and hoping they worked well. I also asked about general GitHub navigation, how to best find pull requests.
* What still confuses you about Git?
	- I'm not certain I'm "confused", I think I'm just uncertain from time to time, but with competence comes confidence.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	- I loved it. It was my first time programming with anyone else. I've always done it solo. The pair programming is great because you have someone guiding the process so you can focus on the actual typing. They also can pick up on any small errors you may have made in the process. The guide is awesome because you can bounce ideas quickly off of them and ask small questions to get quick clarification instead of stopping what you're doing and looking it up, or worse, letting it go unasked.
