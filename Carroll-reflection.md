# Reflections about GPS 1.1

Greg 

- What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  - Merging branches into master.
  - `git revert`
- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  - Something that stood out for me was how to merge the feature branch to master before pushing the master branch. Just needed some more reps.
- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  - Syntax for markdown inline image link from file
- What still confuses you about Git?
  - `git revert` ; I dont have it down quite yet.
- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  - Smooth. Greg was super cooperative and clear in his direction while having no issues being corrected if needed. Our instructor was also very good. He stayed fairly hands off until we got to a point where we missed a step and got us back without wasting time.
